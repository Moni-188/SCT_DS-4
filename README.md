The objective of this task is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an accident dataset and visualize key factors affecting accident severity using Python.

📁 Dataset
The dataset contains records related to road accidents.
It includes features such as:
Accident Severity
Weather Conditions
Type of Junction
Other contributing factors

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas – data manipulation
Matplotlib – data visualization
Seaborn – statistical plots

🔍 Steps Performed
Imported required libraries
pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
Loaded the dataset
Read the CSV file into a DataFrame
Data Understanding
Checked dataset shape, columns, and data types
Identified target variable (Accident_Severity)
Exploratory Data Analysis
Count plots for accident severity
Analysis of accidents by:
Weather conditions
Type of junctions
Data Visualization
Used countplot to visualize categorical data
Adjusted figure size, rotation, and spacing for clarity

📈 Key Visualizations
Accident Severity distribution
Weather Condition vs Accident Severity
Accidents by Type of Junction
These visualizations help identify patterns and factors influencing accident severity.

✅ Results & Insights
Certain junction types show higher accident frequency
Weather conditions play a role in accident severity
Data visualization makes trends easy to interpret
